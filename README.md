This DLL depends on [the Shared Items Project I use for my reverse-engineered findings](https://github.com/DavidJCobb/skyrim-classic-re). If you were linked here in search of my reverse-engineered findings for Skyrim Classic, then you should go to that repo instead.

SKSE source code and project files are not included unless they needed to be modified in order to build properly.
